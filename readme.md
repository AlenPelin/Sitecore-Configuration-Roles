# CONFIGURATION ROLES SUPPORT

The aim of this project to make Sitecore pre-configured for one of pre-defined 
configuration roles, so after installing a Sitecore instance the only setting 
should be changes: the roles the instance should have.

### Sitecore CMS 8.1 rev. 160302 (Update-2)

In this project Sitecore configuration engine was extended with two simple commands
and modified configuration files that use them. It is distributed as a module which
is based on the `Sitecore CMS 8.1 rev. 160302 (Update-2)` which now allows patching 
configuration engine.

## How to

### 1. Install NuGet Package

First you need to do is to install the `Sitecore.Configuration.Roles` NuGet package:
```ps
PS> Install-Package Sitecore.Configuration.Roles
```
Alternatively, you can [download it here](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/releases).

### 2. Modify web.config file

Second step is required to enable configuration engine in the web.config file.
```xml
  <configSections>
    <section name="sitecore" type="Sitecore.Configuration.Roles.RoleConfigReader, Sitecore.Configuration.Roles" />
    ...
  </configSections>
```

### 3. Modify Include *.config files

Go thorough your confiugration files and annotate configuration nodes that must be presented only in certain kind of instances. For examplem, the `Sitecore.ContentSearch.Lucene.Index.Master.config` is intended to be used only in the `authoring` environment:
```xml
 <configuration xmlns:role="http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/role/">
      <sitecore>
        <contentSearch>
          ...
              <index id="sitecore_master_index" role:require="authoring">
```

### 4. Deploy

Your solution is ready to deploy, so deploy the following files to both `authoring` and `delivery` Sitecore instances:
```
App_Config/Include/Sitecore.ContentSearch.Lucene.Index.Master.config
bin/Sitecore.Configuration.Roles.dll
```

### 5. Update instances roles

Last step is to change `web.config` files of both `authoring` and `delivery` Sitecore instances so they are aware of their role. So for `authoring` instance it should be:
```xml
  <appSettings>
    <add name="role:require" value="authoring" />
  </appSettings>
```
and this one for `delivery`:
```xml
  <appSettings>
    <add name="role:require" value="delivery" />
  </appSettings>
```

### 6. Verify if it works

It is not required, but you can verify if it works by opening `/sitecore/admin/showconfig.aspx` and trying to find definition of `sitecore_master_index` index configuration element. If everything went smoothly, you should find it in `authoring` environment and shouldn't in `delivery`.

## Details

### 1.  Define Role Command

    This command can be used only once to avoid accidential misconfiguration. 
    It defines pipe-separated "white list" of roles this Sitecore instance have. 
    
    Example 1:
    
    /App_Config/Include/! Role-Define.config
    <configuration xmlns:role="http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/role/">
      <sitecore role:define="role1|role2|..." />
    </configuration>
    
    Example 2:
    
    /web.config
    <configuration>
      <appSettings>
        <add key="role:define" value="role1|role2|..." />
      </appSettings>
    </configuration>
    
    Roles can be any string, but out of the box this POC offers these roles:
    * authoring
    * publishing
    * dedicated-publishing
    * reporting
    * processing
    * delivery
    
    These roles are described below.       
    
### 2.  Require Role Command

    When this command is applied to a node within Sitecore include config file
    the node will be ignored if the required role is not specified by the Define
    command. 
    
    Example:
    
    <configuration xmlns:role="http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/role/">
      <sitecore>
        <contentSearch>
          ...
              <index id="sitecore_web_index" role:require="authoring|delivery">
                ...

### 3.  Modified configuration files

    The POC is shipped with modified stock configuration files to make Sitecore
    pre-configured to serve each of these configuration roles. 
    
    There are a number of out-of-box roles that attached configuration files 
    are aware of.                     
    
    - authoring 
      
      Defines Content Management (CM) role that allows editors to use editing
      applications like Content Editor, Page Editor etc.
      
    - publishing
      
      Defines Publishing role that allows current Sitecore instance to
      process publishing requests. It can be enabled on the same instance
      with other roles or on a dedicated Sitecore instance.
      
    - dedicated-publishing
    
      Defines Dedicated Publishing (Pub) role that allows current Sitecore 
      instance to behave as dedicated publishing instance. It can be enabled
      only on single Sitecore instance in solution.
      
    - reporting
      
      Defines xDB Reporting (Rep) role that fetches reporting data from various 
      data sources to use in Sitecore reporting applications. It can be enabled
      on the same instance with other roles or on a dedicated Sitecore instance.
      
    - processing
      
      Defines xDB Processing (Proc) role. It can be enabled on the same instance 
      with other roles or on a dedicated Sitecore instance.
      
    - delivery
      
      Defines Content Delivery (CD) role that assumes current Sitecore instance
      is accessed only by end-users and Sitecore administrators. It cannot be 
      enabled on the same instance with other roles.
